Aged Citizen Dies

John R. Cox, a well known citizen of this section, aged about 77 years, died at his home near Brushy Run Sunday evening. He was sitting in a chair and suddenly expired. Mr. Cox had not been in good health for some time, although he was able to be out, and not long ago paid this office a visit.

The deceased was born on the farm where he died, his life being spent at the old home where he raised his family. He was a good husband, father, neighbor, and friend, and all were sorry to hear of his death. He was buried Tuesday in the family burial ground, Rev. Don M. Nicholas officiating.
